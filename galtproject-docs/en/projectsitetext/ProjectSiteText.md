## Simple Answer

John Galt Project - a project, funded by a group of private investors, to develop open-source software for land tokenization (accounting, buying and selling on blockchain) and self-governance in the form of a set of smart contracts in the Ethereum blockchain, which gives effective tools for any group of people (crypto-enthusiasts, landowners, small nationalities and local tribes):
- add his own land plot to the Project and be a part of a global Comminity, receive legal support from the Project partners in legal disputes;
- to sell or buy land with the help of the Project software with all legal formalities;
- buy or use their own land and raise an investment fund for its development: the construction of roads, hospitals, schools, the development of the economy by investing in companies and start-ups;
- to divide land plot between several landowners by auction if needed;
- determine the weight of each landowners in voting in elections in proportion to the contribution to the fund;
- elect fund managers and give them the right to dispose of the fund's assets;
- to make sure that fund managers increase the amount of assets in the fund by means of competent investments in infrastructure, companies and people;
- at any time, withdraw the cryptographic keys from the current fund managers and transfer them to another managers;
- at any time, withdraw assets from the fund;
- at any time, split the fund into several funds by landowners voting;
- to regulate the relationship between the landowners by means of cryptography;
- confirm the oneâ€™s right to own or lease a land plot using cryptography.

## Manifest

The John Galt project is an initiative to develop open-source software for land tokenization and self-governance based on Ethereum blockchain, funded by a group of private investors.

The project will be developed according to the following plan:

1. Anyone can join the Project by making a record of his land plot in the World Land Cadastre, provided by the Project. This cadastre is independent and supranational. Land ownership  will be permanently recorded in the Ethereum blockchain. With the help of project Software and legal mechanisms land owners can buy, sell and transfer land plots, as well as receive legal support for land disputes from the legal partners of the Project.

2. The Project will launch a Pilot Project of a settlement managed by Cryptography. This settlement will be in a reliable legal jurisdiction and will be bought from its current owner. In this place, self-government mechanisms will be developed with the help of cryptography: collection of funds to maintain infrastructure, election of managers, voting for decision-making. We are now choosing a site for this Pilot Project, most likely it will be a land on one of the Indonesian islands near to Singapore.

3. A project will be launched to create an economy and a society of people living in a place that does not belong to any state. This place is now called Bir Tawil, has an area of 2,060 km2 and currently does not belong to any state. The project will be launched with support and in conjunction with local tribes. In this place we will try to collect people guided by the principles of the free market, meritocracy, honest work, innovation and [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule). For investment in infrastructure (roads, airport, hospital, security), and companies will be raised the investment Fund. Actions of the Fund and disbursement of it's assets will be managed by all residents through elected delegates - the Board of Directors of the Fund. Basic economic rights and duties will be governed by smart contracts in the Ethereum network. The contracts will guarantee the full right at any time to re-elect the Delegates, withdraw some of the Fund's assets, by a group of people for self-governance or completely withdraw assets, by each person at any time. The creators of the Project will at their own expense ensure the development of smart contracts, conduct a study of the Bir Tawil and conduct fund-raising for the Fund. Until the election of the Delegates, the Fund's assets will be frozen. The creators of the project will not have access to these assets.
