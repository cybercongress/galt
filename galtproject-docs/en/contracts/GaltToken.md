# Contract Galt Token - Documentation.
For `Terms` - [Glossary](https://github.com/andromedaspace/galtproject-docs/blob/master/en/Glossary.md).
## Problem Description.
The `Project` needs an ERC20 contract and a `Token` to account for the investments of `Project participants` in the `Funds` that will develop the `Territory` and the equivalent of a digital right to all `Project Territories` without the right to specific `Land Plots`. The closest analogue is the land share.

## Contract goals.
- the GALT `Token` allows to take into account the contribution of each `Project Participant` to the `Project Funds`;
- the GALT `Token` allows to provide liquidity of `Funds`. This means that all `Project Funds` at any time are required to automatically redeem GALT tokens from their owners;
- the GALT `Token` allows to determine by auction the true true of the `Land Plots`;
- the GALT `Token` allows to automatically transfer Ethers between `Project Funds`;
- the GALT `Token` is the equivalent of a share in all `Project Funds` and in all `Project Territories`;

## Contract Specification.
- Token name (name) - `GALT Token`;
- Token symbol (symbol) - `GALT`;
- Number of decimal places (decimals) - `18`;
- Max. the possible number of minted Tokens - `2 ^ 256 / 1e18 = 1.1579209e + 59`;

The contract uses the implementation of the [OpenZeppelin Mintable ERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/tree/master/contracts/token/ERC20) standard. The contract uses the implementation of the [BurnableToken](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-solidity/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/BurnableToken.sol) standard.
