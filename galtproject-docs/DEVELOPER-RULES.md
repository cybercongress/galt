## Rules

### Terms formatting
- Add term in the glossary
- Use unified naming/terminology

### File names formatting
- Use only english
- Use "-" as a separator only for logically different parts of a file name. Correct names are: `ManagementFee`, `SmartSpace`, `SmartSpace-Rental`(SmartSpace is a contract type, while Rental is a concrete implementation). Bad file names are `Management_Fee` or `Smart-Space`.
